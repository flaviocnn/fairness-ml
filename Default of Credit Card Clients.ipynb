The Chi-Square statistic is most commonly used to evaluate Tests of Independence when using a crosstabulation (also known as a bivariate table).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Crosstabulation presents the distributions of two categorical variables simultaneously, with the intersections of the categories of the variables appearing in the cells of the table. The Test of Independence assesses whether an association exists between the two variables by comparing the observed pattern of responses in the cells to the pattern that would be expected if the variables were truly independent of each other. Calculating the Chi-Square statistic and comparing it against a critical value from the Chi-Square distribution allows the researcher to assess whether the observed cell counts are significantly different from the expected cell counts.\n",

    "It give us a probability of finding some association by chance in the case of independence of variables (association strength = 0). Very small p-value, usually lower than 0.05, tell us the null-hypothesis is rejected, so the considered variables are related and not independent.\n",

    "### Pearson standardized residuals \n",
    "The strength of a relation can be thought as a measure of how much the observed values deviate from the values in case of independence (independence = total missing of any kind of relation among variables). The Pearson standardized residuals measure the departure of each cell from independence."
